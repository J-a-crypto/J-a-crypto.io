										<h2 class="major">Passions</h2>
										<p>If I had one single word to defines me it would have to be music. If I were to look at any picture that I have of myself
											they all would 100% would show me with an airpod in listening to music. I feel like its a lifestyle. Waking up to some 80s pop, working through the day with 
											some R&B or rap and relaxing with some jazz at night. This sounds like the pefect day and also a lot of Beatles songs sprinkled in between. I also play electric guitar,
											I was self taught and I am still learning and a way I keep myself consistant is by having my guitar sit on my desk chair so I HAVE to play it before I go to using my computer.
											I am a movie watcher and am open for recommendations, I have been watching a lot of romance. I have began readng again and it's been relaxing.

										<h2 class="major">WHY TECH?</h2>
										<p>If you think about what defines a futuristic future it would be technological advancements.
											Even the tech we have today is crazy to think about, we got so used to using a smartphone but 
											this has got to be one of the most powerful tool and it's able to fit in our pockets so we have it on us at all times.
											The world of tech is fascinating because there is always something new being discovered which makes life tasks more easier 
											for us. I would like to contribute to this world in any way I can by writing lines of code to make life even more efficient  
											and easier for the community, now AI is rising and it's so insane! My fascination with technolgoy has driven me to pursue a career as a 
											computer scientist and I am excited to continute learning and growing in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
